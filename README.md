# WindowsMANIA
This was the final project for my advanced C++ class. The assignment was to combine some elements the professor wrote with our own code to make an OS. 

The assignment was to use Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) to make a GUI for our OS. 
To run the program, run the executable "FinalAtSchool.exe". 

WinDir.exe, Henway2, BattleOffice2, and menu.exe were all written and provided by the professor, Arland Richmond.
